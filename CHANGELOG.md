### BREAKING CHANGES

* release workflow specifies test and release Node.js versions

The release.yml workflow now accepts two inputs specifying Node.js
version:

1. `test-node-versions`
2. `release-node-version`

The former specifies which Node.js versions will be used to run
the `build` and `test` npm scripts before invoking `semantic-release`,
and the latter specifies which Node.js version to use to invoke
`semantic-release`.
